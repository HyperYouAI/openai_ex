## Project Notes

## Programming Style 

When writing Elixir code, embrace functional programming and "The Elixir Way". Prefer pattern matching over conditional logic and use pipe operators (|>) for clear data transformations. Leverage recursion and list comprehensions instead of imperative loops. Keep functions pure and composable where possible. Make effective use of with/else for clean error handling. Structure code around OTP principles when dealing with stateful operations. Design with immutability and concurrency in mind. Use protocols for polymorphic behavior. In short, write **beautiful**, idiomatic Elixir.
